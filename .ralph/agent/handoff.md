**Original objective:**

```
# MeetBalls — Local-First Meeting Assistant CLI

## Problem Statement

Meetings generate valuable information that is lost because note-taking is distracting,
recordings sit unwatched, and paid transcription services add cost and privacy concerns.
Developers need a zero-cost, privacy-respecting tool that captures meeting audio,
transcribes it locally, and enables interactive Q&A against the transcript using Claude Code CLI.

## What To Build

A minimal, opinionated, shell-script-driven CLI too...
```
